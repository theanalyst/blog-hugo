Moved my blog from pelican to [Hugo][1]. Though there was nothing
wrong with pelican as such, mostly I found a problem with my
blog/theme not as update with pelican upstream. Hugo is a static site
generator written by Steve Francia ([@spf13][2]). It is written in Go
& amazingly fast to generate a site. Developing sites with hugo
is kind of fun; running hugo in watch mode, you get to see the site as
you write. Also hugo has a nice set of themes and rather simplistic
approach to organizing content. Hopefully the new avatar of the blog
should keep me interested in blogging for a while!
