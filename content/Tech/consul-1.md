[Consul][1] is a great tool for service discovery. It is distributed
and highly available (CA if you're into the CAP sort of thing). It
provides a DNS interface and a highly available Key Value store. This
post is very much an introductory level post, baby steps for service
discovery using consul. We will be using docker to quickly take consul
out for a test drive.
